# NieR Automata Switch Accessories (NASA)
Modifies NieR:Automata (Steam) to add support for the NX DLC

# Installation
- Install the Nintendo Switch NieR port files (REQUIRES LIMIT BTEAK)
- Download and install the nier-mod-loader: https://github.com/xxk-i/nier-mod-loader/releases
- Place NASA.dll in <NIER-DIR>/data/mods/plugins/*
- Alternatively, inject the DLL into NieR:Automata on startup using your preferred method

# IMPORTANT
The accessories are currently highest priority, although I don't know when I will do them. Feel free to open issues on this repo but I probably won't be able to get to them. The code in this repo is really just IDA pseudocode copy and paste, nothing too complicated - other devs should be able to pick it up basically immediately.

# Known/Probable issues
- Certain 9S sequences probably don't look as they should with switch outfits equipped
- Outfits don't show as ```ACTIVE``` when equipped and cannot be de-equipped
    - Fix by equipping a normal DLC outfit and unequipping

# Planned updates
- Fix ```ACTIVE``` flagging
- Add support for accessories
- Add support for pods

# MAYBE updates
- Allow for dynamically loaded modded outfits and mesh-groups
