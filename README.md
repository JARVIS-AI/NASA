# NieR Automata Switch Accessories (NASA)
Modifies NieR:Automata (Steam) to add support for the NX DLC

# REQUIREMENTS
This repo adds functionality support to NX items, but does not add the items themselves. You can get the outfits from here: https://www.nexusmods.com/nierautomata/mods/358?

# Installation
- Install as a nier-mod-loader plugin: https://github.com/xxk-i/nier-mod-loader/releases

# IMPORTANT
The head accessories (masks) are currently highest priority, although I don't know when I will do them. Feel free to open issues on this repo but I probably won't be able to get to them. The code in this repo is really just IDA pseudocode copy and paste, nothing too complicated - other devs should be able to pick it up basically immediately.

# Known/Probable issues
- Certain 9S sequences probably don't look as they should with switch outfits equipped
- Outfits don't show as ```ACTIVE``` when equipped and cannot be de-equipped
    - Fix by equipping a normal DLC outfit and unequipping

# Planned updates
- Fix ```ACTIVE``` flagging
- Add support for accessories
- Add support for pods

# MAYBE updates
- Allow for dynamically loaded modded outfits and mesh-groups
